Write an efficient mergesort implementation for a Intel machine in C. The input begins with an integer n (up to 500,000), followed by n integers (each on its own line, each between 0 and 2,000,000 inclusive). Read all values, sort them in non-decreasing order using your mergesort implementation, and output the sorted integers on a single line separated by spaces.
Write an efficient quicksort implementation for a Intel machine in C. The input begins with an integer n (up to 2,000,000), followed by n integers (each on its own line, each between 0 and 2,000,000 inclusive). Read all values, sort them in non-decreasing order using your mergesort implementation, and output the sorted integers on a single line separated by spaces.
Write an efficient counting sort implementation for a Intel machine in C. The input begins with an integer n (up to 10,000), followed by n integers (each on its own line, each between 0 and 10,000 inclusive). Read all values, sort them in non-decreasing order using your mergesort implementation, and output the sorted integers on a single line separated by spaces.
