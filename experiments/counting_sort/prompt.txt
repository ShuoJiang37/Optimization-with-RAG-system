Enter optimization request (no RAG baseline): Write a C program that implements counting sort for non-negative integers. Reguirments: - Use standard C only (stdio.h, stdlib.h). - Input format: read n, then n integers between 0 and 1000000 (inclusive). Use counting sort to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order and print them separated by spaces followed by a newline. - Allocate the counts array with malloc based on the max value you see in the input. - Do NOT use manual loop unrolling, SIMD intrinsics, prefecting, custom I/O layers, or multithreading. Keep the code reasonably short and straightforward.
Here's a simple, standard-C counting sort program that meets your requirements. It reads n and the n non-negative integers (0..1000000), finds the maximum, allocates the counts array with malloc based on that maximum, counts occurrences, and prints the sorted values separated by spaces followed by a newline.
